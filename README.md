### Key Metrics:
-	Total Customers: (120) We gathered feedback from 120 customers.
- Repeat Purchasers: 69 
-	Non-repeat: (51) Over half of our customers have purchased more than once, which indicates a decent level of return business.
-	Countries Covered: (10) These customers are spread across 10 different countries, as seen on the map.
-	Average Satisfaction Score: (5.35 / 10) On average, our customers are moderately satisfied. This is neither excellent nor poor, it shows room for improvement.
### Satisfaction Breakdown across all
- **The Matrix Visual**: illustrates the average customer satisfaction score across various experience-related factors, helping us understand what’s driving satisfaction and where gaps may exist.

Some factors, like Product Quality, packaging, product variety have higher satisfaction scores, indicating that customers are pleased with those areas. Others, such as ease to use, features, price, support availability, brand reputation show lower scores, signaling potential dissatisfaction or unmet expectations.

- **The Doghnut Chart**: Customers who contacted support had an average score of 5.36. Those who didn’t had 5.34.
  
 Support Contacted is currently not a key driver of customer satisfaction, meaning that our support service is neutral, support isn’t affecting satisfaction negatively , but it’s not adding value either.. We should consider making it more impactful

- Clusttered Column Chart: Low-loyalty customers are more satisfied than even the high-loyalty ones — this is unusual and requires investigation.

 Meaning that high satisfaction does not guarantee loyal customers.
