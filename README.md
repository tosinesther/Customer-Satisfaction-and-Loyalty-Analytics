### Key Metrics:
-	Total Customers: (120) We gathered feedback from 120 customers.
- Repeat Purchasers: 69 
-	Non-repeat: (51) Over half of our customers have purchased more than once, which indicates a decent level of return business.
-	Countries Covered: (10) These customers are spread across 10 different countries, as seen on the map.
-	Average Satisfaction Score: (5.35 / 10) On average, our customers are moderately satisfied. This is neither excellent nor poor, it shows room for improvement.
### Satisfaction Breakdown Across All
- **The Matrix Visual**: illustrates the average customer satisfaction score across various experience-related factors, helping us understand what’s driving satisfaction and where gaps may exist.

Some factors, like Product Quality, packaging, product variety have higher satisfaction scores, indicating that customers are pleased with those areas. Others, such as ease to use, features, price, support availability, brand reputation show lower scores, signaling potential dissatisfaction or unmet expectations.

- **The Doghnut Chart**: Customers who contacted support had an average score of 5.36. Those who didn’t had 5.34.
  
 Support Contacted is currently not a key driver of customer satisfaction, meaning that our support service is neutral, support isn’t affecting satisfaction negatively , but it’s not adding value either.. We should consider making it more impactful

- **Clusttered Bar Chart**: Low-loyalty customers are more satisfied than even the high-loyalty ones — this is unusual, Meaning that high satisfaction does not guarantee loyal customers.
  
- **The Line and Clustered Column Chart**: Repeat purchasers are more satisfied than one-time buyers. There’s a visible drop in satisfaction for customers who did not return after their first purchase which suggests that customer satisfaction is linked to customer loyalty—happy customers are more likely to return.
  
- **Clusttered Bar Chart**: •	Repeat customers has an Average score of 5.62 while One-time buyers is 4.98 This clearly shows that customers who come back are more satisfied— we can say retention is linked to satisfaction.
  
- **Clustered Column Chart**: this chart lists the satusfaction factor with the most dissatisfied customers (low scores). Top 3 complaints include:Ease of Use, Brand Reputation, Support Availability
These three are our main pain points. Fixing them could significantly improve satisfaction loyalty and definitely will lead to increase in number of repeat purchasers.

- **Map Chart**: Some locations have more non-repeat buyers, suggesting lower loyalty in those regions.
- **Clustered Column Chart**: Breakdown of total customers based on satisfaction categories (High, Medium, Low) by gender.

   Females show a higher number in the low satisfaction category (28) they are less satisfied overall than male customers. While Males are more evenly distributed.
 
 - **Satisfaction Factor By Gender (Matrix chart)**: Female customers love the features and customer service, but struggle with usability and value for money and support availabilty. Male customers value ease of use, product quality and packaging more, and have stronger brand trust than the female.
- **Loyal Customers By Gender(Matrix Chart)**: More female customers fall into the Low Loyalty group, which aligns with low satisfaction. Males tend to lean toward the High Loyalty group more.
- **Clustered Bar Chart**: We have the Largest customer segment to be Age 55–60. Other strong groups: 35–39, 45–49. Smaller numbers in 25–29 and under

  Older customers tend to be more loyal, especially in the 55–60 group. While Younger groups are underrepresented, and those who are present are not particularly loyal.

### Recommendations
- Based on the analysis, OmniRetail should prioritize improving key pain points such as price perception, support availability, Features, ease to use and brand reputation, as these factors received the lowest satisfaction scores and contributed most to customer dissatisfaction.

#### Efforts should also focus on:

- Enhancing support experiences, as support contact currently has minimal positive impact on satisfaction.

- Engaging first-time buyers, since repeat purchasers show significantly higher satisfaction—improving first impressions can boost retention.

- Targeted improvements by region, leveraging location-based insights to address satisfaction gaps in underperforming cities.

- Customizing strategies by demographic, especially age and gender groups with lower loyalty or satisfaction trends.

- Investing in these areas will likely increase overall customer satisfaction, strengthen loyalty, and improve long-term retention and profitability.
